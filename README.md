User stories:
                <ul>1) I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.</ul>
                <ul>2) If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow a valid website format (www.example.com), 
                  the JSON response will contain an error instead.</ul>
                <ul>3) When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.</ul>
